Pointing devicesPeople can use a pointing device like a trackpad or mouse to navigate the interface and initiate actions.

People appreciate the precision and flexibility that pointing devices offer. On a desktop, people typically expect to combine a pointing device with a keyboard as they navigate apps and the system. On mobile and other touch-capable devices, a pointing device gives people an additional way to interact with apps and content, without replacing touch, eyes, or gestures.

## Best practices

Be consistent when responding to mouse and trackpad gestures. People expect most gestures to work the same throughout the system, regardless of the app or game they're using. On desktop systems, for example, people rely on common gestures to behave consistently whether they're browsing individual document pages, webpages, or images.

Avoid redefining systemwide trackpad gestures. Even in a game that uses app-specific gestures in a custom way, people expect systemwide gestures to be available. Remember that users can customize the gestures for performing systemwide actions.

Provide a consistent experience in your app, whether people are using gestures, eyes, a pointing device, or a keyboard. People expect to move fluidly between multiple types of input, and they don't want to learn different interactions for each mode or for each app they use.

Let people use the pointer to reveal and hide controls that automatically minimize or fade out. In mobile and tablet devices, for example, people can reveal minimized controls by holding the pointer over them (the controls minimize again when the pointer moves away). People can also move the pointer to reveal or hide playback controls while they watch a full-screen video.

Provide a consistent experience when people press and hold a modifier key while interacting with objects in your app. For example, if people can duplicate an object by pressing and holding the Option key while they drag that object, ensure the result is the same whether they drag using touch or the pointer.

## Platform considerations

### Mobile

Mobile devices with pointer support extend the traditional pointer experience, automatically adapting the pointer to the current context and providing rich visual feedback at a level of precision that enhances productivity and simplifies common tasks on a touchscreen device. The pointer system gives people an additional way to interact with apps and content — it doesn't replace touch.

Allow multiple selection in custom views when necessary. On supported mobile devices, people can click and drag the pointer over multiple items to select them. As people use the pointer in this way, it expands into a visible rectangle that selects the items it encompasses. Standard nonlist collection views support this interaction by default; if you want to support multiple selection in custom views, you need to implement it yourself.

Distinguish between pointer and finger input only if it provides value. For example, a scrubber can give people an additional way to target a location in a video when they're using the pointer. In this scenario, people can drag the playhead using either the pointer or touch, but they can use the pointer to click a precise seek destination.

Pointer shape and content effectsMobile devices integrate the appearance and behavior of both the pointer and the element it moves over, bringing focus to the item the pointer is targeting. You can support the system-provided pointer effects or modify them to suit your experience.

By default, the pointer's shape is a circle, but it can display a system-defined or custom shape when people move it over specific elements or regions. For example, the pointer automatically uses the familiar I-beam shape when people move it over a text-entry area. Video with custom controls.  Content description: A video snippet showing the bottom half of a new event popover in Calendar. At the beginning of the video, the pointer is within the URL field and it uses the I-beam shape. As the pointer moves between the URL and Notes fields, it briefly reverts to its default circular shape; when the pointer enters the Notes field, it uses the I-beam shape again.  Play With a content effect, the UI element or region beneath the pointer can also change its appearance when people hold the pointer over it. Depending on the type of content effect, the pointer can retain its current shape or transform into a shape that integrates with the element's new appearance. Mobile devices define three content effects that bring focus to different types of interactive elements in your app: highlight, lift, and hover.

The highlight effect transforms the pointer into a translucent, rounded rectangle that acts as a background for a control and includes a gentle parallax. The subtle highlighting and movement bring focus to the control without distracting people from their task. By default, mobile devices apply the highlight effect to bar buttons, tab bars, segmented controls, and edit menus. Video with custom controls.  Content description: A video snippet showing a small area at the bottom of a Photos window. Nature photos that show purple flowers, rocks in a stream, and grass are visible just above the tab bar, which shows the Photos and For You tabs. At the beginning of the video, the Photos tab is highlighted. Because bar items receive the highlight effect, the pointer becomes the highlighted rounded rectangle that surrounds the tab's glyph and title. The highlighted rounded rectangle slides from one tab to the other as the pointer moves.  Play The lift effect combines a subtle parallax with the appearance of elevation to make an element seem like it's floating above the screen. As the pointer fades out beneath the element, the system creates the illusion of lift by scaling the element up while adding a shadow below it and a soft specular highlight on top of it. By default, mobile devices apply the lift effect to app icons and to buttons in Control Center. Video with custom controls.  Content description: A video snippet showing the left end of the Dock in front of the Home Screen. From the left, the visible app icons are Messages, Safari, Music, Mail, and Files. As the pointer moves across the first three icons from the left, it disappears beneath each icon in turn, lifting it slightly and letting it return to its original position before moving to the next icon.  Play Hover is a generic effect that lets you apply custom scale, tint, or shadow values to an element as the pointer moves over it. The hover effect combines your custom values to bring focus to an item, but it doesn't transform the default pointer shape. Video with custom controls.  Content description: A video snippet showing an alert floating above the top half of a new event popover in Calendar. The alert contains text that reads Are you sure you want to discard this new event? and a button titled Discard Changes. As the pointer moves into the alert button, the button background darkens.  Play Pointer accessoriesPointer accessories are visual indicators that help people understand how they can use the pointer to interact with the current UI element. For example, a pointer approaching a resizable element might display small arrows to indicate that the element allows resizing along a certain axis.

Unlike pointer shapes and content effects, accessories are secondary items that can combine with any pointer to communicate additional information.

Use clear, simple images to create custom accessories. A pointer accessory is small, so it's essential to create an image that communicates the pointer interaction without using too many details.

Consider using the accessory transition to signal a change in an element's state or behavior. In addition to animating the appearance and disappearance of pointer accessories, the system also animates the transitions among accessory shapes and positions that can accompany content effects. For example, you could communicate that an add action has become unavailable by transitioning the pointer accessory from the plus symbol to the circle.slash symbol.

Pointer magnetismMobile devices help people use the pointer to target an element by making the element appear to attract the pointer. People can experience this magnetic effect when they move the pointer close to an element and when they flick the pointer toward an element.

When people move the pointer close to an element, the system starts transforming the pointer's shape as soon as it reaches the element's hit region. Because an element's hit region typically extends beyond its visible boundaries, the pointer begins to transform before it appears to touch the element itself, creating the illusion that the element is pulling the pointer toward it. Video with custom controls.  Content description: A video snippet showing an area at the bottom of Clock. The World Clock tab is selected and clock images and information for San Francisco, New York, and London are partially visible in the window. As the pointer moves in the tab bar, its highlighted rounded rectangle appearance seems to show a slight resistance as it slides from the World Clock tab to the Alarm tab and back again.  Play When people flick the pointer toward an element, the system examines the pointer's trajectory to discover the element that's the most likely target. When there's an element in the pointer's path, the system uses magnetism to pull the pointer toward the element's center.

By default, the system applies magnetism to elements that use the lift effect (like app icons) and the highlight effect (like bar buttons), but not to elements that use hover. Because an element that supports hover doesn't transform the default pointer shape, adding magnetism could be jarring and might make people feel that they've lost control of the pointer.

The system also applies magnetism to text-entry areas, where it can help people avoid skipping to another line if they make unintended vertical movements while they're selecting text.

Standard pointers and effectsWhen possible, support the system-provided content effects. People quickly become accustomed to the content effects they see throughout the system and generally expect their experience to apply to every app they use. To provide a consistent user experience, align your interactions with the design intent of each effect. Specifically:Use highlight for a small element that has a transparent background.

Use lift for a small element that has an opaque background.

Use hover for large elements and customize the scale, tint, and shadow attributes as needed.

Prefer the system-provided pointer appearances for standard buttons and text-entry areas. You can help people feel more comfortable with your app when the pointer behaves in ways they expect.

Add padding around interactive elements to create comfortable hit regions. You might need to experiment to determine the right size for an element's hit region. If the hit region is too small, it can make people feel that they have to be extra precise when interacting with the element. On the other hand, when an element's hit region is too large, people can feel that it takes a lot of effort to pull the pointer away from the element. In general, it works well to add about 12 points of padding around elements that include a bezel; for elements without a bezel, it works well to add about 24 points of padding around the element's visible edges.

Create contiguous hit regions for custom bar buttons. If there's space between the hit regions of adjacent buttons in a bar, people may experience a distracting motion when the pointer reverts briefly to its default shape as it moves between buttons.

Specify the corner radius of a nonstandard element that receives the lift effect. With the system-provided lift effect, the pointer transforms to match the element's shape as it fades out. By default, the pointer uses the system-defined corner radius to transform into a rounded rectangle. If your element is a different shape — if it's a circle, for example — you need to provide the radius so the pointer can animate seamlessly into the shape of the element.

Customizing pointersPrefer system-provided pointer effects for custom elements that behave like standard elements. When a custom element behaves like a standard one, people generally expect to interact with it using familiar pointer interactions. For example, if buttons in a custom toolbar don't use the standard highlight effect, people might think they're broken.

Use pointer effects in consistent ways throughout your app. For example, if your app helps people draw, provide a similar pointer experience for every drawing area in your app so that people can apply the knowledge they gain in one area to the others.

Avoid creating gratuitous pointer and content effects. People notice when the appearance of the pointer or the UI element beneath it changes, and they expect the changes to be useful. Creating a purely decorative pointer effect can distract and even irritate people without providing any practical value.

Keep custom pointer shapes simple. Ideally, the pointer's shape signals the action people can take in the current context without drawing too much attention to itself. If people don't instantly understand your custom pointer shape, they're likely to waste time trying to discover what the shape means.

Consider enhancing the pointer experience by displaying custom annotations that provide useful information. For example, you could display X and Y values when people hold the pointer over a graphing area in your app.

Avoid displaying instructional text with a pointer. A pointer that displays instructional text can make an app seem complicated and difficult to use. Instead of providing instructions, prioritize clarity and simplicity in your interface, so that people can quickly grasp how to use your app whether they're using the pointer or touching the screen.

Consider the interplay of shadow, scale, and element spacing when defining custom hover effects. In general, reserve scaling for elements that can increase in size without crowding nearby elements. For example, scaling doesn't work well for a table row because a row can't expand without overlapping adjacent rows. For an element that has little space around it, consider using a hover effect that includes tint, but not scale and shadow. Note that it doesn't work well to use shadow without including scale, because an unscaled element doesn't appear to get closer to the viewer even when its shadow implies that it's elevated above the screen.

### Desktop

Desktop systems support a wide range of standard mouse and trackpad interactions that people can customize. For example, when a click or gesture isn't a primary way to interact with content, people can often turn it on or off based on their current workflow. People can also choose specific regions of a mouse or trackpad to invoke secondary clicks, and select specific finger combinations and movements for certain gestures.
