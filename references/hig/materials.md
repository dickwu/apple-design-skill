A material is a visual effect that creates a sense of depth, layering, and hierarchy between foreground and background elements.

Materials help visually separate foreground elements, such as text and controls, from background elements, such as content and solid colors. By allowing color to pass through from background to foreground, a material establishes visual hierarchy to help people more easily retain a sense of place.

## Best practices

Use materials to create visual separation and hierarchy between UI layers. Materials provide depth by creating distinct visual planes that help users understand the spatial organization of your interface.

Consider the context and content when choosing material transparency levels. Materials can range from fully opaque to highly transparent, allowing varying degrees of the background to show through. Choose opacity levels that balance visual appeal with readability and usability.

Test materials with different background content and lighting conditions. Materials should maintain good contrast and legibility across various scenarios where they might be used in your app.

## Platform considerations

No additional considerations for mobile and desktop platforms.
