When reviewing or improving UI/UX designs, follow the Apple HIG-based design review process:

1. Read SKILL.md for the full review methodology
2. Read references/hig-lookup.md to find which guideline files are relevant
3. Load the relevant references/hig/*.md files before giving feedback
4. Always cite specific guideline sections in your review
5. Use the user's framework terminology (Flutter, Tauri, Electron, React Native, etc.)

Trigger this process when the user asks to: review a design, audit UI/UX, check accessibility,
improve a layout, implement Liquid Glass / glassmorphism, or evaluate any visual/interaction design.
